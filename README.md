Directional studies using a 2x1 array of detectors for source localization

The ability of an instrument to obtain the azimuth of an unknown source is an invaluable asset in operational field work. A geometric model is presented for the estimation of the source direction using two adjacent cylindrical detectors (2x1 array) which provide a radiation shield to each other.

Tcount ratio of the detectors reveals the direction of the incoming photons. The performance of the array can be improved by placing an external shield, either lead or tungsten, between the detectors. The geometrical model works well for low-energy photons (60 keV). For larger energies Monte Carlo simulations have to be adopted
